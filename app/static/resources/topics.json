Yet as the team has progressed quickly to the Lesotho Premier League, our potential for scalable social and economic change has flourished.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.53664389250834543, "post": "First, playing games is an art.

TFF, the government and other stakeholder must make sure that there is at least one stadium of international standards in every geographical zone.\r\nHowever, the big clubs like Simba, Yanga and AZAM must stop their habits of taking the young talents and hold their chances to play.

And there are so many passionate players that work hard for little recognition or reward. But the professional game is full of greed, cheating and corruption. Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}, {"relevance": 0.26751646032055643, "post": "Offer children in every corner of the globe the opportunity to have their own safe experience with Football, with Play.

Many have missed years of school, college and vocational training and are not equipped to get a job or qualified to go to further education. While some clubs are taking steps to provide their youth players with a more rounded education, not enough is being done to create a culture and infrastructure which can facilitate this education.\r\nInstead of ignoring this education football governing bodies and clubs globally should see this as an incredible opportunity to engage youth, many of whom are from the lowest socio-economic groups and see school as an unnecessary distraction. By combining it with their football life it makes the education side much more agreeable. \r\nAll football governing bodies should create a policy of youth education for players at all clubs. It should include guidelines for education, required time spent working on activities outside of football and a clear and transparent way to monitor the clubs in their efforts.\r\nAll clubs should be required to partner with local schools, colleges, vocational training academies and non-profits as part of this player development process. Their players will have to attend education related to academic studies, job training and personal development throughout the year. In order to be able to progress through the youth football ranks players must achieve certain education goals they set at the start of each year. \r\nMany non-profit organisations are able to teach life skills through football. Their skills should be utilised in order to assist these young players in their personal development. If done effectively it will not only provide them with greater education and employment opportunities after their professional football career is over but it will help them to avoid harmful social problems such as violence, drug and alcohol abuse, unhealthy habits and discrimination.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.042927818300029098}, {"relevance": 0.24511246618462604, "post": "i need ur help,if u help me than can i answer u\r\n", "sentiment": -0.055201480678501898}], "sentiment": 0.048906481762182, "label": "training"}, {"keywords": [{"weight": 1.2757877641342488, "keyword": "source"}, {"weight": 1.0225399194294087, "keyword": "greater"}, {"weight": 0.39787525946004809, "keyword": "responsibility"}, {"weight": 0.31558198254171133, "keyword": "encourage"}, {"weight": 0.30199175754196639, "keyword": "youths"}, {"weight": 0.20852838807300164, "keyword": "encounter"}, {"weight": 0.19610699713282112, "keyword": "news"}, {"weight": 0.19102191099655291, "keyword": "greatest"}, {"weight": 0.17698314494110437, "keyword": "corrupt"}, {"weight": 0.16663989886196504, "keyword": "chances"}, {"weight": 0.1653403365949111, "keyword": "dealings"}, {"weight": 0.16388769192262526, "keyword": "human"}, {"weight": 0.16388769192262526, "keyword": "beings"}, {"weight": 0.16087652245127118, "keyword": "level"}, {"weight": 0.12841538013839315, "keyword": "mean"}, {"weight": 0.12734132348840141, "keyword": "making"}, {"weight": 0.11831931269562281, "keyword": "educating"}, {"weight": 0.095593608702440228, "keyword": "forward"}, {"weight": 0.085779561164148282, "keyword": "save"}, {"weight": 0.085430765828873753, "keyword": "woman"}, {"weight": 0.081366150482669999, "keyword": "federations"}, {"weight": 0.073734955131981209, "keyword": "re"}, {"weight": 0.073614183092375163, "keyword": "inclusion"}, {"weight": 0.073070801539588767, "keyword": "injuries"}, {"weight": 0.072345936946771633, "keyword": "stand"}, {"weight": 0.069026885640139438, "keyword": "competition"}, {"weight": 0.066602493328370913, "keyword": "enable"}, {"weight": 0.063421373216764887, "keyword": "root"}, {"weight": 0.061863135885554296, "keyword": "agreater"}, {"weight": 0.061605448006064795, "keyword": "vast"}, {"weight": 0.061357373361655872, "keyword": "motivated"}, {"weight": 0.059649440518886668, "keyword": "campaign"}, {"weight": 0.057300311926205071, "keyword": "capacity"}, {"weight": 0.050225595770935882, "keyword": "disabilities"}, {"weight": 0.048253921323999333, "keyword": "personal"}, {"weight": 0.047921984391615602, "keyword": "regularly"}, {"weight": 0.047730621762540261, "keyword": "turn"}, {"weight": 0.047208976227498325, "keyword": "ground"}, {"weight": 0.046912898547286114, "keyword": "generation"}, {"weight": 0.044301853601616627, "keyword": "experience"}, {"weight": 0.043405286494454791, "keyword": "teach"}, {"weight": 0.043302427906224801, "keyword": "methodology"}, {"weight": 0.0432973783638156, "keyword": "surrounding"}, {"weight": 0.043209002876484923, "keyword": "looking"}, {"weight": 0.041900990773048825, "keyword": "simply"}, {"weight": 0.040429192998738629, "keyword": "leaving"}, {"weight": 0.04025801627204461, "keyword": "willing"}, {"weight": 0.039798337654008351, "keyword": "themes"}, {"weight": 0.039674280259949915, "keyword": "role"}, {"weight": 0.039300340377107203, "keyword": "informed"}, {"weight": 0.03916065294224845, "keyword": "match"}], "postCount": 8, "posts": [{"relevance": 1.3204215627031406, "post": "If we encourage more Youths to take responsibility of the game it will be a greater source for good\r\n", "sentiment": -0.0020210322905792211}, {"relevance": 1.0571405885158176, "post": "If we lessen the news about corruption the football level will be pushed and it will become a greater source for good.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0096866425822486855}, {"relevance": 0.93273378026512865, "post": "Football can be a greater source for good only if we as human beings become less corrupt in our dealings.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}, {"relevance": 0.34181893141085534, "post": "we can make football a source of good through the power of partnerships.irrespective of ones ability to play, his/her history or level of education , the passion exhibited by that person is the SEED CAPITAL to use in inititating local,national and global partnerships\r\n", "sentiment": -0.00065831927807179908}, {"relevance": 0.31937661778732862, "post": "Procurement procedures of tournaments and even Cup finals, etc. should be subject to democratic procedures: A \"\"Yes\"\" vote through a national referundum (or on local levels, if necessary) should be a mandatory requirement in order to qualify for bidding processes.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.019561484283204256}, {"relevance": 0.30884507119771898, "post": "We have to make Social Responsibility a much bigger issue for clubs in all levels, as well as other football-related organisations and (con)federations.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.19030835283275718, "post": "Football has the power to make the game equally accessible for everyone.

At Kick4Life in Lesotho we are striving to create a new model for a football club where social development is the ultimate goal, driven and enabled on a new level by elite success on the pitch and financial success off it. It is a big shift from our initial approach where we created an elite team alongside our charity programs purely as an outlet for our talented participants to play competitive football. Yet as the team has progressed quickly to the Lesotho Premier League, our potential for scalable social and economic change has flourished. As a traditional charity this was capped, but by creating a cross-sector model we believe we can accelerate and deepen our community impact, as well as creating a model for replication by clubs elsewhere.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.040756059851721135}, {"relevance": 0.18157960727704026, "post": "Many betting companies are all over the world,is there any policy relationship with fifa,uefa financing? if not what is there relationship in football.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.0070862869589564332}], "sentiment": 0.0067678179226364921, "label": "local"}, {"keywords": [{"weight": 1.960032624865907, "keyword": "women"}, {"weight": 0.27833171367998577, "keyword": "equality"}, {"weight": 0.27705757869964209, "keyword": "enthusiasm"}, {"weight": 0.2113144614143237, "keyword": "promoted"}, {"weight": 0.20477403891247981, "keyword": "begin"}, {"weight": 0.17952974721057186, "keyword": "gender"}, {"weight": 0.17033479653414121, "keyword": "governing"}, {"weight": 0.15793885864738622, "keyword": "mixed"}, {"weight": 0.15265354927568026, "keyword": "practice"}, {"weight": 0.14781738461271948, "keyword": "india"}, {"weight": 0.12815475044777172, "keyword": "de"}, {"weight": 0.12585058698575835, "keyword": "com"}, {"weight": 0.1182396064512182, "keyword": "communities"}, {"weight": 0.11369095599768725, "keyword": "rules"}, {"weight": 0.11292773020069065, "keyword": "coach"}, {"weight": 0.11224276276047719, "keyword": "teams"}, {"weight": 0.11007110582824077, "keyword": "necessarily"}, {"weight": 0.10994321839812782, "keyword": "competition"}, {"weight": 0.10914732737145474, "keyword": "decision"}, {"weight": 0.1090448261679107, "keyword": "boys"}, {"weight": 0.10826743132487188, "keyword": "opinion"}, {"weight": 0.10824021048336133, "keyword": "play"}, {"weight": 0.10747096135603926, "keyword": "needs"}, {"weight": 0.1073501708314915, "keyword": "ensuring"}, {"weight": 0.10716045164276973, "keyword": "wc"}, {"weight": 0.10652974433588155, "keyword": "prize"}, {"weight": 0.10645094912639201, "keyword": "challenge"}, {"weight": 0.10620261688654455, "keyword": "promote"}, {"weight": 0.10438726436765285, "keyword": "country"}, {"weight": 0.10170534772983256, "keyword": "hopefully"}, {"weight": 0.10154469612232125, "keyword": "brazilian"}, {"weight": 0.099621106884552085, "keyword": "field"}, {"weight": 0.09837910550908166, "keyword": "governments"}, {"weight": 0.098067041166678137, "keyword": "changed"}, {"weight": 0.096780663593813793, "keyword": "winning"}, {"weight": 0.093695151964670015, "keyword": "encouraging"}, {"weight": 0.092046768853632915, "keyword": "football"}, {"weight": 0.091217834153457356, "keyword": "sports"}, {"weight": 0.088547275939958772, "keyword": "tournament"}, {"weight": 0.088383151763207171, "keyword": "career"}, {"weight": 0.088335107770765628, "keyword": "times"}, {"weight": 0.086124195718437116, "keyword": "regularly"}, {"weight": 0.085379655377874009, "keyword": "negative"}, {"weight": 0.083640559601746475, "keyword": "change"}, {"weight": 0.082787255145856664, "keyword": "organize"}, {"weight": 0.082601997062591401, "keyword": "save"}, {"weight": 0.080892263175677423, "keyword": "addition"}, {"weight": 0.080505185139993538, "keyword": "recruit"}, {"weight": 0.080431485609501127, "keyword": "equally"}, {"weight": 0.078864394710099497, "keyword": "agreater"}, {"weight": 0.078242110195135356, "keyword": "support"}], "postCount": 8, "posts": [{"relevance": 1.4916685739984443, "post": "Football is a sport for everyone, not just for men and boys.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose.

Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}, {"relevance": 0.36255201070741938, "post": "4.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses.

We have games where we provoke cheating and conflict to create opportunities for our participants to solve their own problems honestly and with integrity. In these small-scale activities you see the effects of cheating - one person cheats and it snowballs - how can you compete without succumbing to it? We teach these lessons and praise those who are honest.. but it can be so difficult. Especially in places where corruption is everywhere - in your face, understood, accepted as the status quo.

While some clubs are taking steps to provide their youth players with a more rounded education, not enough is being done to create a culture and infrastructure which can facilitate this education.\r\nInstead of ignoring this education football governing bodies and clubs globally should see this as an incredible opportunity to engage youth, many of whom are from the lowest socio-economic groups and see school as an unnecessary distraction. By combining it with their football life it makes the education side much more agreeable. \r\nAll football governing bodies should create a policy of youth education for players at all clubs. It should include guidelines for education, required time spent working on activities outside of football and a clear and transparent way to monitor the clubs in their efforts.\r\nAll clubs should be required to partner with local schools, colleges, vocational training academies and non-profits as part of this player development process. Their players will have to attend education related to academic studies, job training and personal development throughout the year. In order to be able to progress through the youth football ranks players must achieve certain education goals they set at the start of each year. \r\nMany non-profit organisations are able to teach life skills through football.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4.

We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win.

How can a child dream about football when their league champions are decided before the season even begins?? We have games where we provoke cheating and conflict to create opportunities for our participants to solve their own problems honestly and with integrity. In these small-scale activities you see the effects of cheating - one person cheats and it snowballs - how can you compete without succumbing to it? We teach these lessons and praise those who are honest.. but it can be so difficult. Especially in places where corruption is everywhere - in your face, understood, accepted as the status quo. It's so sad. And it won't change unless the changes are happening from both ends - the top, and the bottom - the leaders of the industry, and the ones who this industry should be all about - the children and the educators (coaches) who lead them. \r\nI've probably just picked the biggest and most challenging issue - but you said there is no crazy at this point! I love the beliefs of Unleash - and the transparency aspect is key here. In our games the participants find their way to the solution of controlling what you can control - yourself. If you aren't corrupt, if you don't cheat -  maybe that will snowball as well. I'm an optimist.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.017044257193357917}, {"relevance": 0.15743131588981799, "post": "Football could be better with developing new methods to make the game more educative and interesting.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.023295436600915802}, {"relevance": 0.1563925795745072, "post": "a round up solution could be easily integrated in all online fantod or ticket purchases. see elefunds.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0037686548395276247}, {"relevance": 0.15032222556431865, "post": "Gender Equality in India is a big challenge.

What a brilliant game to watch! But media paid less attention to it and chooses to show where each men's footballer had spent their vacation this summer, what swag they got and Mario Balotelli :-)\r\nSolution to this- We could have the world's first Mixed football tournament, mostly 5v5 format, in which 3 have to be women and 2 men.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose.

We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.28214657971277946, "post": "we need to take kids out of their environment and comfort zone by taking them to  camps .Team building must be the main ingredients for the Camp as this is suggested to be  done preseason and or in the early stages of the programme.This is were you implement the team methodology/team style of play and the values , as well the goals and the vision of the team for that particular year.\r\nThis should be accompanied by fun activities such as games  depending of the age or the divisions that are in the Camp.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.026076417906361685}, {"relevance": 0.26626471688884895, "post": "Yes, quite easily.\r\nFootball works on many levels. 1) It releases stress levels and endorphins that make people feel better physically 2) This has an effect on the participants physically. 3) People whilst -playing or watching are living in the \"\"moment\"\" which is great for their mental health.4) It encourages team work 5) It provides an opportunity for people to socialise 6) It is good fun\r\n", "sentiment": -0.0014004606356953482}, {"relevance": 0.25075475055748014, "post": "Yesterday I wrote about the health and wellness programme at Tramway FC.

We get confused about this because there are soany well-meaning and hard working people interested game, especially at grass roots level. And there are so many passionate players that work hard for little recognition or reward. But the professional game is full of greed, cheating and corruption. Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

Hopefully as changes occur, the negative rhetoric that often surrounds women's football will begin to dissipate.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.018709585616030779}], "sentiment": 0.039186549981819592, "label": "sport"}, {"keywords": [{"weight": 1.0860117594824306, "keyword": "win"}, {"weight": 0.85808935875425552, "keyword": "promote"}, {"weight": 0.58685846416509702, "keyword": "teach"}, {"weight": 0.46658706281113954, "keyword": "sporting"}, {"weight": 0.46078860364649638, "keyword": "olds"}, {"weight": 0.408560778146492, "keyword": "mutual"}, {"weight": 0.38620107555159539, "keyword": "links"}, {"weight": 0.36507806171841634, "keyword": "shift"}, {"weight": 0.35542349933663769, "keyword": "activities"}, {"weight": 0.34766480114520071, "keyword": "educational"}, {"weight": 0.25713064352632808, "keyword": "create"}, {"weight": 0.24838138163287374, "keyword": "sports"}, {"weight": 0.24726382878806225, "keyword": "united"}, {"weight": 0.24618216595488809, "keyword": "skills"}, {"weight": 0.24522951296912662, "keyword": "place"}, {"weight": 0.19827313865432539, "keyword": "promoted"}, {"weight": 0.18430447165869593, "keyword": "live"}, {"weight": 0.17824899743820144, "keyword": "enthusiasm"}, {"weight": 0.17316591635844006, "keyword": "dylan"}, {"weight": 0.15623873104458136, "keyword": "vision"}, {"weight": 0.15250636892720759, "keyword": "health"}, {"weight": 0.14995025611383969, "keyword": "awareness"}, {"weight": 0.13023812533527401, "keyword": "attend"}, {"weight": 0.12262108422005374, "keyword": "happened"}, {"weight": 0.12164711867996467, "keyword": "sentence"}, {"weight": 0.11999303919773519, "keyword": "role"}, {"weight": 0.11629812799862498, "keyword": "true"}, {"weight": 0.11517873385276323, "keyword": "getting"}, {"weight": 0.11278492255609011, "keyword": "models"}, {"weight": 0.10993870023843869, "keyword": "format"}, {"weight": 0.10592015038084882, "keyword": "events"}, {"weight": 0.10426809718499781, "keyword": "achieve"}, {"weight": 0.099640248179034469, "keyword": "single"}, {"weight": 0.096591091373725749, "keyword": "10"}, {"weight": 0.095998595946754722, "keyword": "kick"}, {"weight": 0.087231329891662809, "keyword": "look"}, {"weight": 0.083438327327709047, "keyword": "share"}, {"weight": 0.07214478610978263, "keyword": "brighton"}, {"weight": 0.064275203755648574, "keyword": "needs"}, {"weight": 0.062517082647541244, "keyword": "points"}, {"weight": 0.060725408492567891, "keyword": "interest"}, {"weight": 0.059866990298364141, "keyword": "generation"}, {"weight": 0.058352545497115937, "keyword": "future"}, {"weight": 0.057888347591605868, "keyword": "need"}, {"weight": 0.055982558406790874, "keyword": "build"}, {"weight": 0.051489080157386576, "keyword": "values"}, {"weight": 0.05146305041457807, "keyword": "basic"}, {"weight": 0.051077015445672079, "keyword": "set"}, {"weight": 0.049773889007596231, "keyword": "ball"}, {"weight": 0.046088918994729673, "keyword": "innovative"}, {"weight": 0.044263734380113731, "keyword": "messi"}], "postCount": 3, "posts": [{"relevance": 1.7124955666704165, "post": "Create an educational sports agenda to teach 4-5-6-7-8 yr olds new principles of football win for us not win for i.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}, {"relevance": 0.22675524998547933, "post": "Professional football should promote fair play much more.

Having a brand on your chest is promoting that brand, simple!\r\nMore specifically, Being a top player and being paid for your performance is one thing. \r\nBut leveraging your own image and community for personal fame and fortune is naive, as the community is not yours just like football is not anyones. The community is there and will follow whoever is at the top of the game, (you as a player) had the skill to get to the top, but you do not OWN the community that follows you, the community is donating their time and bodies to you, as you are in that position. The individual and the football community owns the football community. \r\nYour image as a player is made up and shaped by the community following you. For example. if a player endorses a brand a % of the community buy it this could be 000.000's, and the players gets 000.000's sharing their image BY ACCESSING their community. BUT THIS IS NOT THE DECISION OF THE COLLECTIVE COMMUNITY AND THIS COMMUNITY GET NOTHING IN RETURN. though they have created your worth. Many many fans have paid to see you, bought your football tops, drink bottles, school bags, lunch boxes, posters, footballs, clothing ranges, apps, training videos. they walk around with your name on their back, for free, promoting your brand, for your profit, they follow your stories and share them, like them, comment on them, they give you important time in their life, which could go to someone else..\r\n", "sentiment": 0.021281350790118093}, {"relevance": 0.36524988617926613, "post": "we need to create home work Clubs, were we would encourage our participants to bring their school work to their Coaches to ask for assistants.\r\nThat will create a good relationships both with coaches and parents that is great strategy for development .\r\n", "sentiment": 0.024242318447535376}, {"relevance": 0.33061250664757486, "post": "I have an idea, my work for 14 years in Girona FC.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans.

We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose.

We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity. It would have one top Europe wide league of 20, then a 2nd division of regional leagues (NW Europe - British Isles, Low Countries, Northern France, Northern Germany;  Med - Spain, Portugal, Italy, Southern France, Greece; East - Turkey, Balkans, Hungary, Romania, Poland,  Ukraine, Moldova; Central - southern Germany, Czech Rep, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria; and Scandinavia - Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia). Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}], "sentiment": -0.023459486020882939, "label": "funds"}, {"keywords": [{"weight": 1.0306529634395674, "keyword": "fund"}, {"weight": 0.75330178420365534, "keyword": "global"}, {"weight": 0.60377355500416374, "keyword": "solidarity"}, {"weight": 0.59586172360781964, "keyword": "marketing"}, {"weight": 0.51079700436417241, "keyword": "pay"}, {"weight": 0.48005907987386642, "keyword": "fee"}, {"weight": 0.47603616188211556, "keyword": "investment"}, {"weight": 0.33936841772590159, "keyword": "directly"}, {"weight": 0.32497843936047938, "keyword": "contribution"}, {"weight": 0.27872964818372908, "keyword": "football"}, {"weight": 0.27632684842224392, "keyword": "say"}, {"weight": 0.25644102053406787, "keyword": "talent"}, {"weight": 0.24033201155220438, "keyword": "budget"}, {"weight": 0.22854467458877645, "keyword": "jersey"}, {"weight": 0.21702028793736697, "keyword": "brands"}, {"weight": 0.19513073504391146, "keyword": "partners"}, {"weight": 0.19082974943845143, "keyword": "sponsors"}, {"weight": 0.18590802783686897, "keyword": "event"}, {"weight": 0.17876995410595625, "keyword": "committed"}, {"weight": 0.17501864357199115, "keyword": "invest"}, {"weight": 0.17250811687446027, "keyword": "revenue"}, {"weight": 0.16568475745281536, "keyword": "needs"}, {"weight": 0.14660762658128187, "keyword": "enormous"}, {"weight": 0.14540640433092389, "keyword": "involved"}, {"weight": 0.14445846578107535, "keyword": "leveraged"}, {"weight": 0.1374058885728987, "keyword": "transform"}, {"weight": 0.13559421050774503, "keyword": "themes"}, {"weight": 0.13404119938310186, "keyword": "english"}, {"weight": 0.13191788128621207, "keyword": "related"}, {"weight": 0.12900595572767226, "keyword": "gfg"}, {"weight": 0.12585817214677109, "keyword": "industry"}, {"weight": 0.12483766544341383, "keyword": "allocated"}, {"weight": 0.12385292750519823, "keyword": "give"}, {"weight": 0.12247444686580013, "keyword": "organized"}, {"weight": 0.12189086580947522, "keyword": "lives"}, {"weight": 0.11560235643252396, "keyword": "link"}, {"weight": 0.11296263209039997, "keyword": "understood"}, {"weight": 0.11246230079325058, "keyword": "collectively"}, {"weight": 0.11220633019869995, "keyword": "transparent"}, {"weight": 0.11069482876798482, "keyword": "additional"}, {"weight": 0.093465504619266809, "keyword": "percentage"}, {"weight": 0.091645616666762394, "keyword": "stakeholders"}, {"weight": 0.09065028534485918, "keyword": "individual"}, {"weight": 0.088607643472321723, "keyword": "confederations"}, {"weight": 0.086714741207481599, "keyword": "pro"}, {"weight": 0.083187562029841511, "keyword": "charities"}, {"weight": 0.079618887926401288, "keyword": "power"}, {"weight": 0.077787005076227697, "keyword": "wages"}, {"weight": 0.075925599628957063, "keyword": "fees"}, {"weight": 0.074791399684343382, "keyword": "advertisement"}, {"weight": 0.071230514610357926, "keyword": "average"}], "postCount": 3, "posts": [{"relevance": 1.5295995128150377, "post": "Football shall pay a 1% solidarity fee to a global football for good investment fund.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.020495835505904988}, {"relevance": 1.1973235137539542, "post": "Football has the power to transform lives - through the game directly, its enormous revenue streams and its marketing reach.

We've gotten used to it. If something happens often enough, I guess it no longer is news. It is time we all stop and say 'Hold on! I see where we are headed and I don't like it'. Football has the power to be that stage on which we all stand and declare in one voice that this is not something we want to see. Associations and clubs have the power - financial might and the fact that they have a voice that is heard - to really make a difference. Fans have the power of numbers. If the fact that Arsene Wenger didn't sign a defensive midfielder can provoke such heartfelt debate between thousands of individuals, surely we can channelize that indignation and anger to try and resolve other pressing issues as well? \r\nIn the end, our biggest asset is our passion - our passion for the game, our passion for wonderful plays, our passion for what we feel is right and wrong. It is time we find our voice in expanding our sphere of discussion and use the power of that voice to make a difference. Surely 70 migrants who suffocated to death in the back of a truck are just as important as a goalkeeper who is capable of winning a game single handedly?\r\n", "sentiment": -0.04335298206273578}, {"relevance": 0.48260655168216515, "post": "I believe football should be used as a way to engage people to be part of community centres or schools.

The most succesful businessmen, who have run and grown companies rigidly and carefully, enter the world of football with a mission and vision but before they know it become blurred in their judgement by the beauty of the match-day.

Rightsholders have multiple opposing stakeholders (sponsors, fans, media, shareholders, governing bidies) and those stakeholders need to become alligned  through clarity and education.  Only when the structures are in place, the power of the individual (or group of individuals) becomes marginalised.  Only when everyone is equally informed can democratic processes take place and can the power of football be unleashed.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.00031846064621022591}, {"relevance": 0.55707365690323196, "post": "football stadiums across the world should act a global pick up points for people in need, so, 50,000 fans per stadium are invited to drop off clothes, money, time etc - every game!\r\n", "sentiment": -0.023576949403172308}, {"relevance": 0.53859098832459529, "post": "Everyone involved in this game should be responsible and accept any result, loss or victory, of the game and not to blame others.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.18958936640022686, "post": "I use this medium to reecho my thoughts concerning the taking football as a means of social change to the next level by calling for the development of football in africa as a means of supporting out-of-school boys and girls who are passionate about the game. it is no doubt the football is a very influential and loving sports among young african people, thus many wants to be like their favorites players such as drogba, mikel, toure, eto'o etc. the support for the development of the sport in african will not only provide employment for the teaming young boys and girls in africa, but it will platform for a kind of informal education, reduce crime and promote social integration. support for development does not end with giving monies to the FAs, but to ensure that corrupt football administrators are kicked out of the system, funds monitored for the purpose to which it was donated and infrastructures such as mini stadia encouraged in little and poor communities. social initiative such as sfw should be given opportunity to benefit from social funding to benefit poor or disadvantage communities. the bane of underdevelopment of football in africa is caused by corruption and selfishness of administrators. local league must be given due attention for standard as a means of absorbing some of the best legs rather than all looking forward to playing in europe as the only mean of competitiveness. capacity of officials must be improved through seminars and courses.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.014916038401839853}, {"relevance": 0.18838579863950133, "post": "Governments and Football Federations can make football a greater source for good by creating more safe spaces for women to play in their communities or allocating field space for women and girls to play regularly.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.003172560332064903}, {"relevance": 0.18294454563120982, "post": "People need to know that football is already being used for good.

We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity. It would have one top Europe wide league of 20, then a 2nd division of regional leagues (NW Europe - British Isles, Low Countries, Northern France, Northern Germany;  Med - Spain, Portugal, Italy, Southern France, Greece; East - Turkey, Balkans, Hungary, Romania, Poland,  Ukraine, Moldova; Central - southern Germany, Czech Rep, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria; and Scandinavia - Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia). Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}, {"relevance": 0.16620017603226772, "post": "Good governance is the key to solving all contemporary challenges to sport.

English clubs spent $1.3 Billion on transfer deadline day screamed one headline. Another page had the heartbreaking image of a 3 year old lying face down - washed up on a beach in Bodrum, Turkey. He drowned along with his entire family when they were attempting to flee Syria in a vessel that wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes in a bathtub let alone the Aegean. \r\nThat football is a business is undeniable. It's also great that it is. It has made the game more global and has given more people access to the beautiful game. One can hardly escape the hordes of young teenagers wearing a Manchester United shirt or a blue football kit with Hazard emblazoned on the back even in my hometown of Chennai in southern India (traditional cricket country). Heck, I'm one of them (not the young teenager part though). However, there is a part of me that wonders - How can we justify a football club spending $50 Million dollars on a teenage striker when there are millions who are risking their lives to flee war torn lands? How can we justify thousands of laborers dying while building stadia in the middle of the desert so that the world can enjoy a spectacle that lasts 30 days?\r\nIt is almost as though our collective conscience has been numbed. We've gotten used to it. If something happens often enough, I guess it no longer is news. It is time we all stop and say 'Hold on! I see where we are headed and I don't like it'. Football has the power to be that stage on which we all stand and declare in one voice that this is not something we want to see. Associations and clubs have the power - financial might and the fact that they have a voice that is heard - to really make a difference. Fans have the power of numbers. If the fact that Arsene Wenger didn't sign a defensive midfielder can provoke such heartfelt debate between thousands of individuals, surely we can channelize that indignation and anger to try and resolve other pressing issues as well? \r\nIn the end, our biggest asset is our passion - our passion for the game, our passion for wonderful plays, our passion for what we feel is right and wrong. It is time we find our voice in expanding our sphere of discussion and use the power of that voice to make a difference.

In these small-scale activities you see the effects of cheating - one person cheats and it snowballs - how can you compete without succumbing to it? We teach these lessons and praise those who are honest.. but it can be so difficult. Especially in places where corruption is everywhere - in your face, understood, accepted as the status quo. It's so sad. And it won't change unless the changes are happening from both ends - the top, and the bottom - the leaders of the industry, and the ones who this industry should be all about - the children and the educators (coaches) who lead them. \r\nI've probably just picked the biggest and most challenging issue - but you said there is no crazy at this point! I love the beliefs of Unleash - and the transparency aspect is key here. In our games the participants find their way to the solution of controlling what you can control - yourself. If you aren't corrupt, if you don't cheat -  maybe that will snowball as well. I'm an optimist.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.017044257193357917}, {"relevance": 0.092482578258220025, "post": "Rich people can simply learn to play and then play with poor people. \r\nGoing into townships or villages and simply kicking the ball, without teaching.\r\nFootball can equalise power-relations.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.011135018582540273}, {"relevance": 0.091931449057337022, "post": "This sentence can be found in your home page 'Football is for everyone, irrespective of gender, race or creed.

He drowned along with his entire family when they were attempting to flee Syria in a vessel that wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes in a bathtub let alone the Aegean. \r\nThat football is a business is undeniable. It's also great that it is. It has made the game more global and has given more people access to the beautiful game. One can hardly escape the hordes of young teenagers wearing a Manchester United shirt or a blue football kit with Hazard emblazoned on the back even in my hometown of Chennai in southern India (traditional cricket country). Heck, I'm one of them (not the young teenager part though). However, there is a part of me that wonders - How can we justify a football club spending $50 Million dollars on a teenage striker when there are millions who are risking their lives to flee war torn lands? How can we justify thousands of laborers dying while building stadia in the middle of the desert so that the world can enjoy a spectacle that lasts 30 days?\r\nIt is almost as though our collective conscience has been numbed. We've gotten used to it. If something happens often enough, I guess it no longer is news. It is time we all stop and say 'Hold on! I see where we are headed and I don't like it'. Football has the power to be that stage on which we all stand and declare in one voice that this is not something we want to see. Associations and clubs have the power - financial might and the fact that they have a voice that is heard - to really make a difference. Fans have the power of numbers. If the fact that Arsene Wenger didn't sign a defensive midfielder can provoke such heartfelt debate between thousands of individuals, surely we can channelize that indignation and anger to try and resolve other pressing issues as well? \r\nIn the end, our biggest asset is our passion - our passion for the game, our passion for wonderful plays, our passion for what we feel is right and wrong. It is time we find our voice in expanding our sphere of discussion and use the power of that voice to make a difference.

We get confused about this because there are soany well-meaning and hard working people interested game, especially at grass roots level. And there are so many passionate players that work hard for little recognition or reward. But the professional game is full of greed, cheating and corruption. Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity. It would have one top Europe wide league of 20, then a 2nd division of regional leagues (NW Europe - British Isles, Low Countries, Northern France, Northern Germany;  Med - Spain, Portugal, Italy, Southern France, Greece; East - Turkey, Balkans, Hungary, Romania, Poland,  Ukraine, Moldova; Central - southern Germany, Czech Rep, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria; and Scandinavia - Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia). Then the third tier would be within nations - the top team in each of the five regional leagues would play play-off relegation challenges against the bottom five teams in the Europe wide league, and the National champions would likewise play a play-off challenge against the lowest ranked teams in the regional league at tier two.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.050028058839687348}], "sentiment": 0.0048919227395842601, "label": "power"}, {"keywords": [{"weight": 1.811874660234583, "keyword": "hours"}, {"weight": 0.99194664035852975, "keyword": "players"}, {"weight": 0.77524455450063445, "keyword": "set"}, {"weight": 0.70863655517086577, "keyword": "week"}, {"weight": 0.63177848707019935, "keyword": "amount"}, {"weight": 0.60873094829870389, "keyword": "dedicate"}, {"weight": 0.60719548765631681, "keyword": "regard"}, {"weight": 0.56407945202334708, "keyword": "professional"}, {"weight": 0.5528874642825643, "keyword": "engagement"}, {"weight": 0.54040831541859868, "keyword": "charity"}, {"weight": 0.5375521656612523, "keyword": "agents"}, {"weight": 0.52392577329417422, "keyword": "purpose"}, {"weight": 0.50831075311596496, "keyword": "exposed"}, {"weight": 0.40125234991199366, "keyword": "access"}, {"weight": 0.39311282113139845, "keyword": "raise"}, {"weight": 0.2547845105992847, "keyword": "requirement"}, {"weight": 0.23189887405285947, "keyword": "involved"}, {"weight": 0.22348226077658648, "keyword": "contract"}, {"weight": 0.20420620642319715, "keyword": "top"}, {"weight": 0.19678794338921568, "keyword": "end"}, {"weight": 0.19591773735652962, "keyword": "meet"}, {"weight": 0.16829791408525402, "keyword": "social"}, {"weight": 0.15440705560469847, "keyword": "support"}, {"weight": 0.12389653573766371, "keyword": "hour"}, {"weight": 0.11651587526277007, "keyword": "practice"}, {"weight": 0.10930045080644386, "keyword": "team"}, {"weight": 0.10886262368176233, "keyword": "choice"}, {"weight": 0.10480475200574221, "keyword": "staying"}, {"weight": 0.079433680830073822, "keyword": "country"}, {"weight": 0.079407964315989052, "keyword": "facilities"}, {"weight": 0.076722632974311616, "keyword": "target"}, {"weight": 0.072970837258153926, "keyword": "conferences"}, {"weight": 0.069193521573275227, "keyword": "player"}, {"weight": 0.068978105440901341, "keyword": "press"}, {"weight": 0.065130268552061651, "keyword": "contribute"}, {"weight": 0.062151343166636605, "keyword": "stand"}, {"weight": 0.05911342843291166, "keyword": "complete"}, {"weight": 0.059075796957611219, "keyword": "agreement"}, {"weight": 0.056424801242229525, "keyword": "opportunities"}, {"weight": 0.05278716786807261, "keyword": "required"}, {"weight": 0.052706349013591301, "keyword": "wages"}, {"weight": 0.051345117041965142, "keyword": "poorest"}, {"weight": 0.047801981577278115, "keyword": "spend"}, {"weight": 0.042990356048316199, "keyword": "fund"}, {"weight": 0.041051785528861469, "keyword": "network"}, {"weight": 0.040382734391735529, "keyword": "society"}, {"weight": 0.03991304019253647, "keyword": "healthy"}, {"weight": 0.039268629494451819, "keyword": "european"}, {"weight": 0.039213537361975387, "keyword": "promote"}, {"weight": 0.035717266914602426, "keyword": "program"}, {"weight": 0.034840108105078559, "keyword": "highest"}], "postCount": 3, "posts": [{"relevance": 2.1807085227192418, "post": "Players should have 4 hours a week to dedicate to purpose and access to professional support in this regard, without gatekeeping agents.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.026830488194978627}, {"relevance": 2.162750477487418, "post": "First team and youth players have a little requirement in their contract in which they have to meet a set amount of hours where they have to be involved in charity by the end of the year.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.19172632924434849, "post": "Like a concert starts with an opening act, let big international matches start with a 15 minute 'opening match' played by a local grassroot club.

While some clubs are taking steps to provide their youth players with a more rounded education, not enough is being done to create a culture and infrastructure which can facilitate this education.\r\nInstead of ignoring this education football governing bodies and clubs globally should see this as an incredible opportunity to engage youth, many of whom are from the lowest socio-economic groups and see school as an unnecessary distraction. By combining it with their football life it makes the education side much more agreeable. \r\nAll football governing bodies should create a policy of youth education for players at all clubs. It should include guidelines for education, required time spent working on activities outside of football and a clear and transparent way to monitor the clubs in their efforts.\r\nAll clubs should be required to partner with local schools, colleges, vocational training academies and non-profits as part of this player development process. Their players will have to attend education related to academic studies, job training and personal development throughout the year. In order to be able to progress through the youth football ranks players must achieve certain education goals they set at the start of each year. \r\nMany non-profit organisations are able to teach life skills through football. Their skills should be utilised in order to assist these young players in their personal development.
