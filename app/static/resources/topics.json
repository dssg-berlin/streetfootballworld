Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

Government should ensure that despite the urbanisation that takes place now, children must not suffer the effect of missing a play ground just in the excuse of urbanization and city extensions.\r\nSecond is to redeem physical and sports education in schools from primary level. This will help our children with focus while empowering them with game motivations and instincts.\r\nThird, to strengthen competitive environment for inschool competitions while sporting talents who will be helped with formal academies available \r\nFourth, increase number of academies while upgrading the existing firms. These academies must be supplied with modern equipment and with strong medical team. \r\nFifth, all clubs should really put emphasis in academy and youth teams. In the other hand, TFF must desperately relook on youth leagues and avoid politics on this. The league is almost useless while players don't receive the care and support they deserve. We can produce something from these young ones.\r\nFinally, availability of standard play grounds. TFF, the government and other stakeholder must make sure that there is at least one stadium of international standards in every geographical zone.\r\nHowever, the big clubs like Simba, Yanga and AZAM must stop their habits of taking the young talents and hold their chances to play. If they don't have a plan to use them in a particular season they better loan them or leave them to go when they will have enough game time.\r\nI beg to submit\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0076538190827550182}, {"relevance": 0.37995202990107058, "post": "In co-operate enterprenureships  skills into football so as footballs after retairing from active sports can have something to do as than them becoming begars.football can be looked at as aventure in life not as apass time game.footballs will also be looked at as role modles to the young generation in the community they by making thegreatest game to be a greater source for good.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.01082096841911105}, {"relevance": 0.37860969278006507, "post": "Rather than universities only offering football scholarships to the best young players, why not save some spaces for students who take initiative and run football-based development programmes.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.0021378862426545391}, {"relevance": 0.36635809503748346, "post": "le centre football for hope contribu a l'epannouissement des jeunes filles , a la formation ainsi qu'a l'education des jeunes.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.028505791346890762}, {"relevance": 0.35918253907820308, "post": "le football donne de l'espoir aux jeunes desesperes et les centres football for hope en sont des exemples d'espoir.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.025155546765080021}], "sentiment": 0.013973496648742988, "label": "young"}, {"keywords": [{"weight": 1.300183649448061, "keyword": "girls"}, {"weight": 0.41389191957185656, "keyword": "boys"}, {"weight": 0.31569378316639435, "keyword": "reach"}, {"weight": 0.17948265382590989, "keyword": "al"}, {"weight": 0.17579559417191531, "keyword": "budget"}, {"weight": 0.15437750591218641, "keyword": "focus"}, {"weight": 0.13595523370866605, "keyword": "special"}, {"weight": 0.13547958049802672, "keyword": "find"}, {"weight": 0.12303032902043488, "keyword": "participation"}, {"weight": 0.12001973361223583, "keyword": "allowing"}, {"weight": 0.11615277166716868, "keyword": "strength"}, {"weight": 0.11277351975059764, "keyword": "looking"}, {"weight": 0.11061428483782768, "keyword": "training"}, {"weight": 0.10666972589271259, "keyword": "empowering"}, {"weight": 0.10279748738917074, "keyword": "dominated"}, {"weight": 0.10028656871996204, "keyword": "resources"}, {"weight": 0.095480158984330335, "keyword": "improve"}, {"weight": 0.095139236706888272, "keyword": "lives"}, {"weight": 0.083138229542227271, "keyword": "study"}, {"weight": 0.082306170585852614, "keyword": "male"}, {"weight": 0.077895948799423742, "keyword": "academies"}], "postCount": 13, "posts": [{"relevance": 1.0763604520405137, "post": "to reach girls\r\n", "sentiment": -0.026223056048225619}, {"relevance": 0.97238056992822708, "post": "Football has the power to improve the lives of women and girls by allowing them to play, find their inner strength, and prove that girls can do whatever boys can do!\r\n", "sentiment": 0.020667526097897473}, {"relevance": 0.93118614679204958, "post": "Girls and boys football should have the same budget and focus.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.0028120405337310052}, {"relevance": 0.86408951565484959, "post": "Empowering young girls in male-dominated societies through girls only soccer academies.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.051205335147872504}, {"relevance": 0.78944606880066781, "post": "La pratique du football par les filles leur donne confiance en elles, facilite leur implication dans la active, leur participation \u00e0 la gestion de leur cit\u00e9.

When kids are on the pitch, it doesn't matter where they are from or how much money they have.  They all speak the same language:  the language of football.

Unlike many other sports or activities, football doesn't need expensive equipment or formal training.... and every country around the world has captured the spirit of football.\r\nSo ... we can make the game a greater source for good by building more connections & showing the youngest players that we are all more alike than different.  We are all just players on the pitch and humans in the world.  A subtle shift in mindset can create a massive shift in world views ... that can lead to collaboration, community, and even world peace.\r\nI am the CEO/Co-Founder of Tea Collection (www.TeaCollection.com) as well as a mom of two avid football players in Oakland, CA.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.11095409903341888, "post": "Ich sehe immer nur Fotos von verbissenen Spielern, die eben nicht spielen, sondern k\u00e4mpfen.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

A subtle shift in mindset can create a massive shift in world views ... that can lead to collaboration, community, and even world peace.\r\nI am the CEO/Co-Founder of Tea Collection (www.TeaCollection.com) as well as a mom of two avid football players in Oakland, CA.  My company strives to inspire global connection and curiosity & I believe that football will be a great way to do just that.  We have an initiative we are working on & I am wondering if we could be helpful in your campaign.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field.

While some clubs are taking steps to provide their youth players with a more rounded education, not enough is being done to create a culture and infrastructure which can facilitate this education.\r\nInstead of ignoring this education football governing bodies and clubs globally should see this as an incredible opportunity to engage youth, many of whom are from the lowest socio-economic groups and see school as an unnecessary distraction. By combining it with their football life it makes the education side much more agreeable. \r\nAll football governing bodies should create a policy of youth education for players at all clubs. It should include guidelines for education, required time spent working on activities outside of football and a clear and transparent way to monitor the clubs in their efforts.\r\nAll clubs should be required to partner with local schools, colleges, vocational training academies and non-profits as part of this player development process. Their players will have to attend education related to academic studies, job training and personal development throughout the year. In order to be able to progress through the youth football ranks players must achieve certain education goals they set at the start of each year. \r\nMany non-profit organisations are able to teach life skills through football. Their skills should be utilised in order to assist these young players in their personal development.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.26492104050496307, "post": "While there are many things that can happen at Grassroots level, it is important that the overall structure of the management of the game changes soon.

The common tagline \"\"football is a religion\"\" highlights the importance and the pitfall of football.  Like religion, when you strip down football from its cooperate, political, and egocentric dogma's,  the true identity of football has been lost.   It is not just FIFA or Blatter at the root of the problem, it is seen across all levels in the football hyrachie, the personal motivation of individuals is clouding judgement, rationale and long term vision.  It is not solely about individuals enriching themselves financially, it is mostly about personal pride and glory as a primary motivation.  The most succesful businessmen, who have run and grown companies rigidly and carefully, enter the world of football with a mission and vision but before they know it become blurred in their judgement by the beauty of the match-day.  They become the talk of town, they are the center of attention at birthday parties, they become loved and loathed by the masses (fans), they hold the key to joy and happyness of the community, and they subsequently want to make an immediate impact.   There are exceptions, but generally, the sport is being run by succesful commercial and political alpha individuals with little or no attention to their respective organisation, the clients, and ultimately the needs of the fans.   How can we blame them? We can't! Unleashing the power of football requires a professionalisation at all levels.  The sport is opportunity driven, not structure driven.  Rightsholders have multiple opposing stakeholders (sponsors, fans, media, shareholders, governing bidies) and those stakeholders need to become alligned  through clarity and education.  Only when the structures are in place, the power of the individual (or group of individuals) becomes marginalised.  Only when everyone is equally informed can democratic processes take place and can the power of football be unleashed.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.00031846064621022591}, {"relevance": 0.38870926490213903, "post": "National Coed Soccer League so everyone has a place to be accepted\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0167767401955944}, {"relevance": 0.3871531819011404, "post": "le football permet de concentrer le temps et l'energie de la jeunesse sur le sport au lieux d'autres choses plus nefastes par le biais des centres football for hope.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.037079226704636363}, {"relevance": 0.35212538225236728, "post": "l'existence des centres de football aide a l'education (sant\u00e9, scolaire et l'orientation professionnel) des jeunes les jeunes a rester chez eux\r\n", "sentiment": 0.035325045473138465}, {"relevance": 0.31480319973527343, "post": "Use football to teach life skills , promote health and social awareness ,make the world a better place to live in\r\nWhizzKids United\r\n", "sentiment": 0.045793766160883029}, {"relevance": 0.30233365613337515, "post": "If every professional soccer player would take the responsibilty to be a mentor for one socially deprived child from his / or her hometown with regard to soccer, then this mentorship could function as a kind of social capital that helps the kids to grow personally and professionally, to broaden their perspectives on life and last but not least, to build a network of trust and recognition.

He drowned along with his entire family when they were attempting to flee Syria in a vessel that wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes in a bathtub let alone the Aegean. \r\nThat football is a business is undeniable. It's also great that it is. It has made the game more global and has given more people access to the beautiful game. One can hardly escape the hordes of young teenagers wearing a Manchester United shirt or a blue football kit with Hazard emblazoned on the back even in my hometown of Chennai in southern India (traditional cricket country). Heck, I'm one of them (not the young teenager part though). However, there is a part of me that wonders - How can we justify a football club spending $50 Million dollars on a teenage striker when there are millions who are risking their lives to flee war torn lands? How can we justify thousands of laborers dying while building stadia in the middle of the desert so that the world can enjoy a spectacle that lasts 30 days?\r\nIt is almost as though our collective conscience has been numbed. We've gotten used to it. If something happens often enough, I guess it no longer is news. It is time we all stop and say 'Hold on! I see where we are headed and I don't like it'. Football has the power to be that stage on which we all stand and declare in one voice that this is not something we want to see. Associations and clubs have the power - financial might and the fact that they have a voice that is heard - to really make a difference. Fans have the power of numbers. If the fact that Arsene Wenger didn't sign a defensive midfielder can provoke such heartfelt debate between thousands of individuals, surely we can channelize that indignation and anger to try and resolve other pressing issues as well? \r\nIn the end, our biggest asset is our passion - our passion for the game, our passion for wonderful plays, our passion for what we feel is right and wrong. It is time we find our voice in expanding our sphere of discussion and use the power of that voice to make a difference.

It is not solely about individuals enriching themselves financially, it is mostly about personal pride and glory as a primary motivation.  The most succesful businessmen, who have run and grown companies rigidly and carefully, enter the world of football with a mission and vision but before they know it become blurred in their judgement by the beauty of the match-day.  They become the talk of town, they are the center of attention at birthday parties, they become loved and loathed by the masses (fans), they hold the key to joy and happyness of the community, and they subsequently want to make an immediate impact.   There are exceptions, but generally, the sport is being run by succesful commercial and political alpha individuals with little or no attention to their respective organisation, the clients, and ultimately the needs of the fans.   How can we blame them? We can't! Unleashing the power of football requires a professionalisation at all levels.  The sport is opportunity driven, not structure driven.  Rightsholders have multiple opposing stakeholders (sponsors, fans, media, shareholders, governing bidies) and those stakeholders need to become alligned  through clarity and education.

The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n", "sentiment": 0.023726512300538471}, {"relevance": 0.55090720595678444, "post": "Most talents are identified and built in Europe from Africa,in africa we have no better infrastructure for football development,stadiums are constructed within 6 years of use,equipments are out of use,poor maintainance,corruption and weak leadership and governance.\r\nWhat is the role of proffessional players recriuted from Africa and their inputs in the continent.\r\nWe need leaders with vision for football and to serve not personal gains,as there is no body above football and football is for us all.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.0095853364298581767}, {"relevance": 0.48609083618735555, "post": "By investing in solid resources for communities, we can focus on strengthening the play opportunities and programs that will further enrich them through play.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.00808488186655653}, {"relevance": 0.48305074250279756, "post": "Use football as a platform to bring joy and hope to youth in communities that have suffered natural disasters.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.043854175765463917}, {"relevance": 0.47764608286784449, "post": "La coupe du monde doit permettre de f\u00e9d\u00e9rer les pays qui vivent sur les m\u00eame espace g\u00e9ographique (exemple: Afrique de l'Ouest). c'est \u00e0 dire l'Afrique de l'Ouest doit \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une \u00e9quipe des meilleurs joueurs de la zone s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s  \u00e0 partir d'un championnat organis\u00e9 entre les diff\u00e9rents pays de la zone g\u00e9ographique  cette \u00e9quipe sera financ\u00e9e par la communaut\u00e9 toute enti\u00e8re.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0026488770140947054}, {"relevance": 0.44984442633419219, "post": "Football could be better with developing new methods to make the game more educative and interesting.\r\n", "sentiment": -0.023295436600915802}, {"relevance": 0.43934489460147813, "post": "All the sponsors should give a 1 to 1.5  minutes space everytime there is a commercial block to feature a very short story about the power and potential football has to change lives in the communities.

Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game?

We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools.
