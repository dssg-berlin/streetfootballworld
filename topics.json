And there are so many passionate players that work hard for little recognition or reward. But the professional game is full of greed, cheating and corruption. Yes, players deserve to make a living, and deserve to earn enough to support themselves after their short playing careers end. But why the multi-millionaire salaries? Why all the hangers-on milking money out of the game? We need to introduce fair salary caps globally across all leagues to level the playing field and give all clubs an equal chance to win leagues, instead of the current situation where a small select group of rich clubs are the only ones that can win. We need to take political power back off the club's and money men, and give it wholly to the fans. We need fan owned clubs and leagues, and make the sponsors, advertisers and media work for us, the fans. We need to reduce the tv rights money in the game which leads to negative media barron input into favourable sheduling. If there is spare money after the capped salaries are covered, it should be invested in improved facilities, grass roots development, and creating equality and access to the game across all regions and countries. We need to make ticket prices affordable - many fans can no longer afford to attend. We need to clean out hardcore ultras, and educate fans about appropriate behaviour - singing and chanting adds character, violence, racism, homophobia and hate ruins the game. Games should be family friendly community events with supporting fun activities for every ages group to make them an affordable fun, family day out. We need to make clubs reconnect with their local community, and ensure they are connected with locals in many ways, such as work skills opportunities for local unemployed, sell food from local businesses, and teach kids in local schools. We need to protect international football and balance it better against club football, and we need to completely gut and reboot Fifa, which is not fit for purpose. We need a fair, transparent World Cup bidding process, in which any registered and vetted fan can have a vote, not just Fifa cowboys.\r\nI would also introduce a Europe-wide league to undermine right wing nationalism, and help contribute to a sense of European unity.

Introducing soccer games, players, and teams starting in elementary school could expand the great game at a young age.  \r\n2. I have learned a lot about soccer through the awesome video game FIFA. Spreading awareness of the video game will teach kids about teams, players, and also inspire them to play themselves. \r\n3. After the USA women's 2015 world cup championship, I believe it is a great time for USA soccer. Expanding and encouraging soccer to young females will grow the sport to new heights. \r\n4. Soccer needs to continue to be encouraged as a universal game that anyone can play, not big business teams trying to take over all the talent. FIFA  needs to be reformed to encourage the game that brings people together. \r\n5. Soccer in the USA has been less popular than other sports due to low scoring games. However, todays athletes are better than ever. Showing that goals are scored a lot more frequently (look at the USA woman championship game) will encourage viewers and fans to the excitement.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.010259770798203303}, {"relevance": 0.62255952990312757, "post": "National Coed Soccer League so everyone has a place to be accepted\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0167767401955944}, {"relevance": 0.50935460621726514, "post": "Ideas to make the greatest game greater:\r\n1) Connect professional soccer teams with local schools to offer tickets as rewards for reading/good grades\r\n2) Offer free tickets to organizations to help underprivileged kids (Boys and Girls Clubs)\r\n3) Donate equipment to local sports teams\r\n4) Promote community soccer leagues for adults and families \r\n5) Have more socially responsible companies sponsor soccer teams/leagues\r\n", "sentiment": 0.0044007211077134152}, {"relevance": 0.50440454426839754, "post": "Let\u2019s create and redefine soccer spaces to serve as vibrant hubs for community, youth inspiration and education.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.045269965898585458}, {"relevance": 0.49191739229413445, "post": "1.)

That said, because of the disparate nature of football structures, it is hard to envisage how such a campaign could be led and how changes could be driven by the people -- the fans -- who are disenfranchised by the industry they sustain.\r\nChange from within is perhaps more realistic. At Kick4Life in Lesotho we are striving to create a new model for a football club where social development is the ultimate goal, driven and enabled on a new level by elite success on the pitch and financial success off it. It is a big shift from our initial approach where we created an elite team alongside our charity programs purely as an outlet for our talented participants to play competitive football. Yet as the team has progressed quickly to the Lesotho Premier League, our potential for scalable social and economic change has flourished. As a traditional charity this was capped, but by creating a cross-sector model we believe we can accelerate and deepen our community impact, as well as creating a model for replication by clubs elsewhere.\r\n", "sentiment": 0.040756059851721135}, {"relevance": 0.58026932932218345, "post": "Football should use its tremendous global platform to combine grassroots / mass participation sports, professional sports and talent pipelines with personal development and holistic education.
