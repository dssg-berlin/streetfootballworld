The club is called Tramway FC,situated in Cape Town, and is celebrating its 92 year birthday in 2015. We have utilized the power of football to attain the following objectives:\r\n1. In view of South Africa's apartheid history, the entire country is literally divided along racial lines. The country's previous group areas act resulted in non-white people being forcibly removed from their houses and communities and placed in areas based upon the colour of their skin. The government established white, coloured, Indian and black communities. Even though South Africa celebrated its 21 year democracy and political transformation in 2015, there has not been a significant racial and economic transformation in the country. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten bigger. Former white areas and schools are unaffordable and often inaccessible for the majority of the country's non-white population. There has thus not been a meaningful integration of diverse communities in South Africa. Tramway FC has successfully transformed our club and partnered with schools and community based organizations to ensure that we are able to integrate diverse racial, religious and socioeconomic communities through the power of soccer. We have bought together young children from very diverse communities onto a soccer field to ensure that meaningful integration and interaction occurs. We start with children as young as 4 years old. We currently have more than 200 children from incredibly diverse backgrounds. It is thus not uncommon to find junior teams at Tramway FC comprising white, black, coloured and Indian children. Additionally, we have muslim, christian and jewish children all being part of the same team and club. The children are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with many children coming from impoverished and poor communities playing in the same team as kids from middle to upper class communities. Through focusing on the children, we are able to bring their parents and families into the club thereby ensuring that adults from diverse backgrounds start engaging on a meaningful manner for the benefit of the kids. Friendships have been formed that has resulted in tolerance and understanding between our diverse communities. Our young children will thus grow up integrated and respect our diverse cultures. Apart from forming strategic partnerships with fellow community-based organizations, our decision to not exclude any child on financial grounds and keep our annual membership fees very low has assisted us in attaining our objective of community integration. Instead, we collectively fundraise which further assists with improving communication with our diverse parents.\r\n2. The largest disease burden at our local hospitals that our community utilize is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). These include complications relating to obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung disease due to smoking. It is well-known that a lack of physical activity, poor diet and smoking are underlying reasons resulting in NCDs. Furthermore, a legacy of apartheid is that the poor schooling and sporting infrastructure in the non-white communities established by our former apartheid government contributes to physical inactivity and poor medical literacy that underpins the development of NCDs. Through the promotion of football we are able to improve the physical activity of young children even their school do not have the sporting infrastructure or capacity to promote sport. \r\n3. Through focusing our efforts on our youth, we are able to access the parents and families of our young children. Since 2013, we have run a free adult health and wellness programme aimed at the families of junior soccer players. We have provided health and fitness screening followed by supervised exercise as well as life, nutritional and anti-smoking counselling to the family members and general community during junior soccer training. This resulted in entire families coming down to the sports facility to participate in healthy living at the same time. Those who were identified with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and other conditions were referred to their local health clinics. This free programme was made possible through recruiting volunteer sports physicians, biokinetisists, psychologists, doctors and nurses. It was conceptualized through myself as the junior chairman at the club and specialist physician at our local hospital.\r\n4. We plan to run a homework and tutoring club prior to junior training at the soccer field. This will allow us to assist our many junior football players with their education in addition to developing their football skills\r\n"}, {"post": "Yesterday I wrote about the health and wellness programme at Tramway FC.

He drowned along with his entire family when they were attempting to flee Syria in a vessel that wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes in a bathtub let alone the Aegean. \r\nThat football is a business is undeniable.

How can we justify thousands of laborers dying while building stadia in the middle of the desert so that the world can enjoy a spectacle that lasts 30 days?\r\nIt is almost as though our collective conscience has been numbed. We've gotten used to it. If something happens often enough, I guess it no longer is news. It is time we all stop and say 'Hold on! I see where we are headed and I don't like it'. Football has the power to be that stage on which we all stand and declare in one voice that this is not something we want to see. Associations and clubs have the power - financial might and the fact that they have a voice that is heard - to really make a difference. Fans have the power of numbers. If the fact that Arsene Wenger didn't sign a defensive midfielder can provoke such heartfelt debate between thousands of individuals, surely we can channelize that indignation and anger to try and resolve other pressing issues as well? \r\nIn the end, our biggest asset is our passion - our passion for the game, our passion for wonderful plays, our passion for what we feel is right and wrong. It is time we find our voice in expanding our sphere of discussion and use the power of that voice to make a difference.

These are produced by speech-to-text-reporters who work remotely. They could, in fact, be reused to make the words of the commentators and analysts understandable to hearing impaired people - on-site or remotely on a mobile app. Almost all the technology we need to do this is already in place in the stadiums so the effort is comparatively small compared to the impact for hearing impaired people. \r\nThe UN convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability has been ratified by the majority of countries worldwide.
